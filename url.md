# URL

All API has the same URL, which is:

* Live Environment: [https://api.pipwave.com/phone-verify](https://api.pipwave.com/phone-verify)
* Test Environment: [https://staging-api.pipwave.com/phone-verify](https://staging-api.pipwave.com/phone-verify)

In order to execute the API of older version, calls must be made instead to \(eg v1\):

* Live Environment: [https://api.pipwave.com/v1/phone-verify](https://api.pipwave.com/v1/phone-verify)
* Test Environment: [https://staging-api.pipwave.com/v1/phone-verify](https://staging-api.pipwave.com/v1/phone-verify)
